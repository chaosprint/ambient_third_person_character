# Third Person Character example for Ambient

Example of manual animation control with [Ambient](https://www.ambient.run/) more or less equivalent to my [animation state machine example](https://github.com/devjobe/ambient_animation_state_machine).

[Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71590722/233990810-63a840a0-f654-48d9-9096-9827f4bf78fd.mp4)

Requires my [Ambient fork](https://github.com/devjobe/Ambient/tree/animation_blend) for `set_animation_blend` to run
